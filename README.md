# Music Streaming and Musicians Presentation

Heyo! This is an overengineered presentation I made for a required freshman English class. This is made in aarthificial's [Motion Canvas.](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas)

### Rendered Output

This is a gif of the rendered presentation. The actual presentation stops on keyed frames. This works out of the box in the motion canvas editor.

### Backstory
* I had extra time before an English presentation. 
* I was learning Motion Canvas anyway for other projects of mine. 
* "If it's worth doing, it's worth over-doing."
* It looks damn good

### How to run

* `git clone https://github.com/MC-Atom/MusicStreamingAndMusiciansPres.git`
* `cd MusicStreamingAndMusiciansPres`
* `npm  install`
* `npm run serve`

This will run a localhost webpage of the Motion Canvas editor showing my code

If you run into problems, the install guide for Motion Canvas is here: https://motioncanvas.io/docs/quickstart
